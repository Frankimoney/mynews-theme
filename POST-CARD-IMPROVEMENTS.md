# MyNews Theme - Post Card & Featured Image Improvements

## Summary of Changes Made

This document outlines all the improvements made to fix the elongated featured images and oversized post cards across all devices (mobile, tablet, and desktop).

## üéØ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Elongated Featured Images**
- **Problem**: Images were stretched with poor aspect ratios (600x400px)
- **Solution**: Reduced to 400x250px with better 8:5 aspect ratio
- **Added**: Mobile-specific image size (350x200px)

### 2. **Oversized Post Cards**
- **Problem**: Card images were too tall (220px) making cards look bulky
- **Solution**: Reduced to 180px on desktop, with responsive scaling down to 140px on mobile

### 3. **Poor Mobile Experience**
- **Problem**: Same large image sizes used across all devices
- **Solution**: Device-specific image heights and optimized card layouts

## üìÅ Files Modified

### 1. **functions.php**
```php
// Updated image sizes
add_image_size( 'mynews-card', 400, 250, true ); // Reduced from 600x400
add_image_size( 'mynews-card-mobile', 350, 200, true ); // New mobile size
```

### 2. **assets/css/blog.css**
```css
.post-thumbnail img {
    height: 180px; // Reduced from 220px
}

// Added mobile-specific rules
@media (max-width: 767.98px) {
    .post-thumbnail img {
        height: 160px;
    }
}
```

### 3. **assets/css/mobile.css**
```css
// Added tablet optimizations (768px-992px)
.post-thumbnail img {
    height: 200px;
}

// Enhanced mobile optimizations (up to 576px)
.post-thumbnail img {
    height: 140px !important;
}
```
